# flexion
flexion is a full-stack web app where users can create an account, share and track their workouts, view user profiles, and interact with other users' comments.

## How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** HTML/EJS, Tailwind, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, Passport.js.

flexion originally began as a simple program where users could upload media to a public board and quickly developed to include user profiles, workout tracking capabilities, and comment/like features.

## Optimizations:
Down the line I look forward to making the workout tracker more dynamic to accomodate various workout formats. Additionally, users will eventually be able to edit their workouts and upload profile pictures.

## Lessons Learned:
flexion helped solidify my understanding of MVC and authentication middleware. I learned how to use method override when spending time working on the like and delete buttons to make PUT/DELETE requests. This was my first project working with Multer and Cloudinary, so navigating the implementation of those was a learning experienced as well.
